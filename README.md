# Regression Analysis for Housing Data

This project implements various regression algorithms to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. The goal is to compare the performance of different regression models and determine which one provides the best predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing Dataset (`HousingData.csv`). It contains information about various features of houses in Boston, such as the number of rooms, crime rate, and property tax rate, along with the median house value (`MEDV`).

## Installation

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Chandan062311/Housing.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Housing

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

You can run the main script `compare_regression_models.py` to compare the performance of different regression models. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

```bash
python compare_regression_models.py
```
You can save this content to a file named `README.md` in your GitHub repository. Feel free to customize it further according to your project's specific details and requirements.
